/*
○ If you need one value from another table, use Mapping. If you need two or more values, use a Join.
○ Takes one value as input, checks if the value exists in a mapping table, and returns the corresponding value from the second column in the mapping table.
○ Has two fields, order is important: (1) Key field (2) Attribute/Value field
○ Mapping section should preceed your other load sections and statements.
○ Mapping tables drop implicitly which is good for keeping your data model clean
○ For a detailed write-up, check out: https://community.qlik.com/t5/Qlik-Design-Blog/Don-t-join-use-Applymap-instead/ba-p/1467592
